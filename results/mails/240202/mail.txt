Hi All,

We've got some promising preliminary results for the 2D case. 

Attached are 3 plots of the localization RMSE on a 2-D grid: (1) for the 6GHz sub-band, (2) for the 24GHz sub-band and (3) for the 6GHz + 24GHz sub-bands. The bottom line is that by using both bands, the RMSE could indeed reach the better of the two results by a mere combination of the AOA + delay parameters. 

To make the scenario hard I've closely placed 3 scattering objects, at (15, 12), (15, 14), (12, 14), and a building with concrete walls having its corners at (8,11) and at (11,15). The base station is at (0,0), the UE is placed at every location between x=8,y=8, to x=15,y=15.

A bit more details on each plot: 
(1) 6GHz sub-band: Only a handful of antennas are not enough to separate LOS/NLOS correctly. Thus the upper-right part is seen to suffer from high RMSE. However, UEs inside the building could be localized.
(2) 24GHz sub-band: The high attenuation at 24GHz causes the signal's power to fall below the noise's power, thus we cannot localize inside and after the building, causing high RMSE at the bottom-right part. However, the LOS could be effectively separated from the NLOS using more antennas. 
(3) 6GHz + 24GHz sub-bands: Able to localize either inside the building or in the vicinity of scattering objects, but not both.

Here I decided the TOA and AOA for each sub-band separately and took the union of the two in the combination. Next, I intend to decide them based on the combined spectrums of the sub-bands as in the research draft, I hope this should solve the problem around (12,14) - localizing both under bad attenuation and in the vicinity of scattering objects.

Any comments are welcome.
